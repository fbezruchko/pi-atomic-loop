Pi package for **atomic coding cycles**: decompose a goal into tiny observable atoms and work on exactly one atom per Pi session, then stop so the operator can test and give feedback. Default is **supervised** (one atom per operator-driven cycle); enable `--until-done` for **autonomous** mode, which runs until an MVP with a new Pi session per atom. Works with commercial and open-source models alike.

## About this fork

This repository is a **personal fork** of the upstream [`pi-loop-mode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-loop-mode) package (also listed on [pi.dev](https://pi.dev/packages/pi-loop-mode), v2.5.4). It is **not** published to npm.

The original package implements an **unattended, endless improvement loop** (the model keeps working on a growing product, driven by an `IMPROVEMENTS.md` backlog, within a single long-running conversation).

This fork changes the core behavior to **atomic coding cycles**: the work is decomposed into tiny observable atoms, and each atom runs in a **genuinely fresh Pi session** — conversation history is never durable state. It adds a cross-session **regression protocol**, a **test-matrix + implementation-first** workflow, and current-atom priority after interruption. See [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) and the [`skills/loop-skill/SKILL.md`](skills/loop-skill/SKILL.md) for the full spec.

## What it does

- **Atomic coding cycles, one atom per session**: supervised or autonomous. Each atom is one small observable behavior with a focused test. One Pi session works on exactly one atom, then stops; the next atom gets a *genuinely fresh* Pi session — conversation history is deliberately not durable state.
- **Supervised mode (default)**: one operator-driven cycle does one atom (minimal change → smoke check → focused tests → docs → `CYCLE_DONE:`), then stops automatically. The operator tests the result and starts the next cycle or gives feedback.
- **Autonomous mode (`--until-done`)**: the controller persists durable state, creates a Git checkpoint, replaces the Pi session, restores state in the new session, and continues until the check passes or MVP is reached — without implementing two atoms in one session.
- **Objective goal function** (`--check "CMD"`): a shell command run after every iteration. Exit code 0 = criteria met (verified completion in `--until-done` mode — the check decides, not the model's claim). Optional `SCORE: <n>` output enables progress tracking: score improvements count as real progress, score regressions trigger an immediate "find and fix the regression" prompt. Essential against models that claim success without delivering.
- **Error resilience**: transient model/provider errors retry with exponential backoff (5s → 5min). Context-pressure failures take a safer path: emergency compaction without another model call, followed by a two-attempt circuit breaker instead of an endless `400` retry loop.
- **Garbage/repetition detection**: repeated assistant answers (exact fingerprints *and* near-duplicates via trigram similarity with numbers masked, alternating A-B-A-B patterns), repeated tool results/errors, repeated questions, and narration-only turns (3 turns without a single tool call) are all detected. Instead of pausing, the loop injects rotating recovery strategies (switch subtask, write PROGRESS.md, run tests and fix one failure, review diffs, list alternative approaches) with escalating delays — important for weaker open-source models that loop on the same output.
- **Degenerate-generation kill switch**: if one sentence dominates a response, one word repeats 16× consecutively, or a short phrase (up to four words) repeats 8× consecutively in visible output or provider thinking/reasoning, the stream is aborted live, the stored message is truncated, and already-poisoned context is sanitized before every LLM call. The abort enters automatic stuck recovery instead of pausing the loop.
- **Escalation ladder on persistent stuck**: rotating strategy → anti-repetition sampling penalties (`frequency_penalty`/`presence_penalty` + higher temperature for 3 turns, OpenAI-compatible APIs only) → hard reset with banned openings → one rescue turn by a stronger model (`--rescue-model M`, after 3 consecutive stuck interventions) → automatic context compaction (after 5).
- **Context-overflow recovery**: a `length` stop with almost no output, or a context-saturated 400/token error, triggers a bounded local compaction built from loop state and durable project files. Saturated manual `/compact` uses the same LLM-independent fallback.
- **Cross-session regression protocol**: a later atom can expose a bug in an earlier completed atom. The loop stops the current feature, marks the atom suspended, records `REGRESSION_FOUND`, fixes the old atom, retests every affected completed atom, and only then resumes the suspended atom — never silently patching while continuing.
- **Test matrix + implementation-first**: behavioral atoms cover 2–3 genuinely distinct positive scenarios and 2–3 genuinely distinct negative/error scenarios; the model implements a minimal change and smoke-checks it before investing in the test harness.
- **Current-atom priority after interruption**: an abruptly interrupted atom is resumed first, not skipped. Selection order is strict: active/incomplete current atom → active regression → first relevant OPEN atom.
- **Durable state + Git checkpoints**: the source of truth between sessions is `GOAL.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `TESTMANUAL.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS.md`, `IMPROVEMENTS.md`, the source files, tests, and git history — never the conversation. Git checkpoints bound each completed atom to a recoverable state.
- **Bounded per-iteration JSONL log** (`.pi-loop-log.jsonl`, 5 MiB + one `.1` backup) with `/loop stats`: event distribution, interventions, atoms completed and atoms/hour, new sessions, productive iterations/hour, score trend — compare models and goal phrasings without unbounded disk growth.
- **No-progress audit**: if no concrete file/system change happens for 8 iterations, the loop demands a tangible artifact (file change, passing test, fixed bug).
- **Never waits for a human**: `LOOP_BLOCKED:` does not pause the loop. The model is told to make a documented assumption (`ASSUMPTIONS.md`) and continue.
- **Auto-resume**: loop state is persisted in the session; after a pi restart/reload an active loop resumes automatically after 3 seconds.
- **Short iterations**: every loop prompt tells the model to do one concrete progress batch and keep output under 1,200 characters, so context stays small and normal compaction works.
- **Operator control**: `Esc` (abort) pauses the loop; `/loop resume` continues it; `/loop finish` soft-stops it (current iteration completes, then no new turn); `/loop stop` stops it immediately; `/loop end` clears state.

## Recommended workflow: separate goal, preparation, and execution

```text
/loop goal <goal + flags>                       # 1. set the goal — starts nothing
/loop prepare --model anthropic/claude-opus-4-6  # 2. strong model writes GOAL.md + check script (ends with GOAL_READY:)
/loop run --model vllm-omega/qwen3-coder-30b --rescue-model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
#                                                # 3. cheap/local model works the loop against the spec;
#                                                #    the rescue model takes over for one cleanup turn when stuck
```

Planning and execution are decoupled: an expensive model writes a precise spec once (`GOAL.md`, reviewable/editable before the run), a cheap or local model executes it for days. The run model is persisted and restored on auto-resume. Switch models mid-run with `/loop stop` + `/loop resume --model M`.

## Commands

Pi slash commands only match the first word, so this package registers a single `/loop` command with subcommands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/loop goal <goal> [flags]` | Set goal + config without starting. `/loop goal` shows it. |
| `/loop prepare [--model M] [--file F]` | Have a (strong) model write the goal spec (`GOAL.md`) + check script. |
| `/loop run [--model M]` | Start the loop, optionally with a different model. |
| `/loop start <goal>` | Shortcut: goal + run in one step (endless loop). |
| `/loop start <goal. Done when: criteria>` | Optional explicit completion criteria. |
| `/loop start <goal> --max 50` | Optional iteration cap (pauses at N). |
| `/loop start <goal> --delay 30` | Wait 30s between iterations. |
| `/loop start <goal> --check "npm test"` | Objective goal check after every iteration. |
| `/loop start <goal> --check "./check.sh" --check-timeout 300` | Check with custom timeout (default 120s). |
| `/loop start <goal> --until-done` | Stop on verified completion (check passes; without check: `LOOP_DONE:`). |
| `/loop start <goal> --rescue-model M` | Stronger model takes over for one cleanup turn after 3 consecutive stuck interventions. |
| `/loop resume [--max N] [--model M] [--rescue-model M]` | Continue a stopped/paused loop, optionally switching models. |
| `/loop status` | Show loop state, errors, interventions, iterations. |
| `/loop stats` | Summarize the per-iteration JSONL log: events, interventions, iterations/hour, score trend. |
| `/loop finish` | Soft stop: finish the current iteration, then stop (state preserved). Alias: `/loop soft-stop`. |
| `/loop stop` | Hard stop: abort the in-flight turn immediately and preserve state. |
| `/loop end` | End the loop and clear state. |
| `/loop help` | Show command help. |

Additionally, the `/loop-examples [focus]` prompt template inspects the current project and proposes ready-to-paste `/loop` commands (features, bug fixing, tests, refactoring, docs) — including model-split setups for weaker/local models. Focus values: `features`, `bugs`, `tests`, `refactor`, `docs`, `quality`.

Example — a 5-day product-building run:

```text
/loop start Build a complete REST API for task management in ./taskapi: CRUD, auth, SQLite, tests, docs. Keep improving it: more features, better tests, bug fixes, refactoring.
```

Then stop it whenever you want with `/loop stop`.

Example — with objective goal function:

```text
/loop start Build a REST API in ./taskapi. Done when: all tests pass --check "cd taskapi && npm test" --until-done
```

### Writing a goal check script

The check command is the loop's fitness function. Exit 0 = done criteria met; print `SCORE: <n>` (higher = better) for progress/regression tracking:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check.sh — example goal function
cd taskapi || { echo "SCORE: 0"; exit 1; }
npm run build >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "SCORE: 0"; exit 1; }   # build must work
passed=$(npm test 2>/dev/null | grep -oE '[0-9]+ passing' | grep -oE '[0-9]+' || echo 0)
echo "SCORE: $passed"
[ "$passed" -ge 50 ] && exit 0 || exit 1   # done when 50+ tests pass
```

Score ideas: number of passing tests, test coverage, implemented endpoints, `-` lint warning count. The score appears in every loop prompt and in the status bar, and drives regression detection.

## How failures are handled

| Situation | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Model/provider error (crash, rate limit, timeout) | Retry with exponential backoff, then "recover" prompt; never gives up. |
| Model repeats the same answer/tool call/question | Stuck intervention with rotating strategies and escalating delay. |
| Model repeats a *near*-identical answer (≥ 80 % trigram similarity, numbers masked) | Also a stuck intervention. |
| Model answers with narration only (3 turns without any tool call) | Also a stuck intervention. |
| One sentence, word, or short phrase repeats mechanically within one response | Stream aborted mid-generation (sentences ≥ 6×, words ≥ 16× consecutively, phrases ≥ 8× consecutively); stored message truncated; automatic stuck recovery continues the loop. |
| 3 consecutive stuck interventions | Hard reset (banned openings, turn must start with a tool call) — or a one-turn takeover by the `--rescue-model`, if configured. |
| 5 consecutive stuck interventions | Automatic context compaction (repetitive filler explicitly excluded from the summary). |
| Any stuck intervention | Additionally: anti-repetition sampling penalties for the next 3 turns (OpenAI-compatible APIs). |
| Model produces analysis but no changes for 8 iterations | Audit prompt demanding a tangible artifact. |
| `CYCLE_DONE:` (supervised) | The current atom is complete and verified — the operator-driven cycle stops. |
| `MVP_READY:` (autonomous) | The smallest genuinely user-testable version is ready — the autonomous chain stops. |
| Model says `LOOP_DONE:` (`--until-done`) | Loop rejects the claim unless the goal check also passes; the model must fix what the check reports. |
| Goal check passes (`--until-done`) | Verified completion — autonomous chain stops. |
| Goal check score drops | Immediate regression prompt: inspect diffs, fix what broke. |
| Goal check command itself fails to run | Warning shown; loop continues without blocking. |
| Model says `LOOP_BLOCKED:` | Loop instructs it to assume, document in ASSUMPTIONS.md, and continue. |
| Operator presses Esc | Loop pauses; `/loop resume` continues. |
| `/loop finish` (soft stop) | Current iteration completes, then the loop stops without a new turn; state preserved for `/loop resume`. Survives restarts (finalized on session start instead of auto-resuming). |
| pi restart / reload | Active loop auto-resumes after 3s, restoring the stored loop model. |
| Loop model unavailable after restart | Warning; loop continues with the current model. |
| `--max N` reached | Loop pauses; `/loop resume` continues (uncapped if exhausted). |

Start or reload pi and run `/loop help`.

> **Security note:** pi packages run with full system access, and this package is built for *unattended* operation — the model works for hours without supervision. Use a dedicated directory/repo, ideally a VM or container, and keep production systems out of reach.

## Notes

- Loop state is persisted with `pi.appendEntry()` and does not add large payloads to model context.
- The loop deliberately allows Pi's normal compaction behavior; short per-turn output keeps multi-day runs compactable.
- Recommended for long runs: work in a git repo so the model can commit incrementally, and tell it so in the goal.
- The bounded per-iteration logs `.pi-loop-log.jsonl` and `.pi-loop-log.jsonl.1` are written to the working directory — add both to `.gitignore` if you don't want them committed.
- "Continue" prompts are slightly varied per iteration; identical prompts encourage identical (repetitive) answers from weaker models.
